Welcome to Modelhub's documentation!
====================================

Crowdsourced through contributions by the scientific research community, 
modelhub is a repository of deep learning models pretrained for a wide variety 
of medical applications. Modelhub highlights recent trends in deep learning 
applications, enables transfer learning approaches and promotes reproducible science.

.. note::  This documentation should contain all essential technical information 
           about the Modelhub project and how to contribute models. It is, however,
           still work-in-progress, so possibly you need to be a little patient
           and persistent. If you find anything unclear, need help, or have
           suggestions, please feel free to contact us at "info at modelhub.ai"
