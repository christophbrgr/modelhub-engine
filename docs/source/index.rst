Welcome to Modelhub's documentation!
====================================

Crowdsourced through contributions by the scientific research community, 
modelhub is a repository of deep learning models pretrained for a wide variety 
of medical applications. Modelhub highlights recent trends in deep learning 
applications, enables transfer learning approaches and promotes reproducible science.

This documentation is still work-in-progress, bear with us while we are working to
finish the implementation and documentation for a first official release.
However, if you are a little patient and presistent, there should alreadt be enough
information here to run models and to contribute your own models to Modelhub.
So feel free to explore the current status of modelhub contact us with questions 
and suggestions :)
